Description
    Transient solver for incompressible flow.

    Sub-models include:
    - turbulence modelling, i.e. laminar, RAS or LES
    - run-time selectable MRF and finite volume options, e.g. explicit porosity
    
    The code is prepared to use HFDIB method and refine the mesh around
    the solids via fvdynamicRefineMesh
    
    Note: the general code structure is the same as in pisoHFDIBFoam
          by Federico Municchi but the HFDIB library itself was slightly
          changed
    Note: although the code should theoretically work with moving meshes
          I only borrow the mesh refinement functionality. the 
          initialMeshRefinement.H is completely useles for the rest of
          dynamic meshes types


Changelog:
* 20190107
    - hoping to correct the problems with hanging pointers
    - the solver still crashes with deltaT -> 0
    - the solver still crashes when the consistent version of PIMPLE is
      used
    - if less than 2 nCorrectors are used, the solver crashes with
      "sizes of addressing and field are different" (WTF?)
    - nCorrectors = 2, nNonOrthogonalCorrectors = 1 => crash with
      "corrupted size vs. prev_size: 0x0000000006d96630"
    - nCorrectors = 2, nNonOrthogonalCorrectors = 2 => runs (CN)
                                                    => crashes (Euler)
      "free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000000006fcb0c0"
    - nCorrectors = 2, nNonOrthogonalCorrectors = 3 => runs but unstable
    - the problem with pointers does not seem to be related to temporary
      fields. neither to temporary matrices
    - manifestation and type of the pointer problem depends on the
      default gradScheme
* 20190110
    - updated the HFDIB class to remove dynamic lists (vectors), which
      solved a lot of problems with mesh refinement
    - forced re-initialization of lambda and f fields on the mesh update
    - !! I need to implement a refinement of the stl surface up to the
      refinementLevel !! (load stl, refine) x refinementLevel
      Note: this will probably force me to load (somehow) the maximal
            mesh refinement level from the mesh object
      Q:    would it be possible to move this whole mesh update and
            stl reloading into the immersed body initialization?
            (I want to keep this class as simple as possible)
* 20190111
    - managed to somehow update the mesh to level 2 (but I needed to
      hardcode the level!?) -> no I don't (see below)
    - CREATE a readDynamicMeshDict.H in which you will get the dynamic
      mesh type and if needed, also the maximum refinement level
      (seems to be the easiest way around)
    - I run the initial mesh-stl ping-pong maxRefinement+1 times to
      enable the final mesh update (split-points)
    - now, with change in the mesh, the solver seems to crash once more
    - created readDynMeshDict.H file in which I explore the dynamicMeshDict
      and if needed, read the maxRefinement and use it later on
    - I still need to solve the bug with solver crashing when I do not
      output each time step at the begining of the simulation
      -> it did not crush (but it may be due to shear luck)
    - I still need to make the solver run in parallel
    - more vigorous testing will be needed (I can test the stl files from
      Martin's (Å ) BC thesis and maybe put together an article on
      comparison of this method with standard OpenFOAM solvers (framework)
      -> look into the case handling complexity, runTime and memory
         requirements

* 20190122
    - the solver seems to work OK (fingers crossed) in serial mode
    - I need to make it run in parallel
    - added forced update of U and Ui if pressure needs a reference
      (now solver does not crash when ran on closed domain, but it is
      far from ideal) => !! STILL CRASHES ON CLOSED DOMAIN !!
